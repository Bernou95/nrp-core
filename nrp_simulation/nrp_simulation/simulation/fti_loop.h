         * Variables and data structures:
         * t  - current simulation time
         * dt - simulation timestep
         * Q  - priority queue which holds pointers to all engines of the simulation
         *      sorted by their current engine time t_e, that is the simulation time at which their last
         *      simulation step has ended. Simulation of each engine is advanced by its timestep dt_e.
         *
         * Initial conditions:
         * - For each engine in Q, t_e = 0
         *
         * Algorithm:
         * 1. Request a simulation step with timestep dt.
         * 2. Find all engines in the priority queue Q, for which t_e <= t, and put them in another queue W.
         * 3. Run the loop for all engines in W. The run_loop step will be executed in parallel for all engines,
         *    even if there are small differences in their current engine time t_e (within the current simulation timestep).
         * 4. For all engines in W, update their engine time t_e += dt_e, and push them back into the queue Q.
         * 5. Update current simulation time t += dt.
         *
         * Remarks:
         * - Engine time is always tracked using the "perfect" (predicted) time instead of the real engine time.
         *   This allows for small fluctuations in the actual engine time returned by the engines, which can be a result
         *   of floating point arithmetics or internal timesteps of the simulators, without disturbing the algorithm.
         *   This is especially important for the point 3. of the algorithm, where any discrepancies in engine time could
         *   change the number of engines chosen for the current loop step.
         * - The actual order of operations on DataPacks and calls to engine's API depends on the type of loop that is
         *   specified in the configuration file
