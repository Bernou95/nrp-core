/*! \mainpage NRP Core

The neurorobotics platform core is the mechanism through which NRP users can implement simulations whereby multiple pieces of simulation software can coexist, synchronize their execution and exchange data in tightly ordered fashion. In previous versions of the NRP, the NRP core was referred to as the "Closed Loop Engine" (CLE), the task of which was to orchestrate the dialogue between the Gazebo robotic simulator and brain models implemented in NEST, Nengo, etc. For those of our users familiar with the CLE, the NRP core is a generalization of the latter, with new generic mechanisms provided to users who want to integrate new simulation engines into their NRP simulations. The NRP core is still built on the so-called Transfer Function framework, although the latter was adapted and renamed \ref transceiver_function "Transceiver Functions" framework. This renaming is not only cosmetic: users familiar with the NRP up to v3.1 should indeed remain aware of some limited but meaningful evolutions between these two frameworks.

The NRP core is mostly written in C++, with the Transceiver Function framework relying on Python for better usability. It guarantees a fully deterministic execution of the simulation, provided every simulator used is itself deterministic, and works on the basis of controlled progression through time steps. Users should thus take note that event-based simulators may not be suitable for integration in nrp-core (to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis). Communications to and from the NRP core are indeed synchronous, and function calls are blocking; as such, the actual execution time of a simulation based on nrp-core will critically depend on the slowest simulator integrated therein.

To understand how to use and operate the NRP core, it is essential to be aware of some terminology used in the rest of this documentation. The NRP core communicates with other simulators or control processes by managing them as \ref engines "simulation engines". The term "engine" refers to an abstraction of the client-server architecture that is implemented for control and communication between the NRP core and every simulator (or process, or module, etc.) that is integrated into a given simulation. These engines exchange data in a standardised way, through objects that we refer to as \ref devices "devices". Defining the proper device for a given simulator in a given simulation is one of the most important steps in using the NRP. It is thus recommended that users take some time to familiarize themselves with this concept before using the NRP core and NRP versions built thereupon.

The documentation is organized in the following sections:
- \subpage getting_started "Getting started": installation guide and walk-through of some simple experiments
- \subpage architecture_overview "Architecture overview": description of the main components and concepts involved in the framework and how they interact with each other
- \subpage simulation_configuration "Simulation Configuration": this section offer details on how experiments in nrp-core are configured
- \subpage nrp_engines "Engines:" list of supported engines as well as their configuration details
- \subpage guides "Guides": guides to create your own experiments, integrate new engines or extend the existing ones and other things
