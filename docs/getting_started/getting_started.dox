/*! \page getting_started Getting started

In order to start working with NRP-core, the latter must be first compiled and installed. The installation guide can be found in the following page: \subpage installation "Installation Instructions"

We provide a number of example experiments within the NRP-core repository. They are located in the `examples` subdirectory. They give a good overview of the capabilities of the NRP and should be relatively easy to adapt to user-specific needs. More details about running these experiments can be found on the pages: \subpage running_example_exp "Running the example experiments", \subpage running_example_docker_exp "Running the example experiments inside different Docker containers" and \subpage running_example_docker_compose "Running the experiments inside different Docker containers with docker-compose".

This \subpage python_client "page" describes how to run NRP-Core experiments from Python.

Please take note that some of the examples may require additional models or dependencies, which may be not included in the NRP-core repository. More information can be found in our \ref tutorial_helpful_info "guide".
