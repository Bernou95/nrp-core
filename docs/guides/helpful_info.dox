\section tutorial_helpful_info_husky Additional Models for Braitenberg Husky experiments

The Husky examples, examples/husky_braitenberg and examples/husky_braitenberg_nest_server, require additional gazebo models that are not included in the NRP-core repository. These assets can be found in other NRP repositories, and the instructions below show how to download and make them available to gazebo.

\code
# Create a new directory, for example in your home directory:
mkdir ${HOME}/nrp
cd ${HOME}/nrp

# Clone our repositories that contain the necessary assets:
git clone https://@bitbucket.org/hbpneurorobotics/models.git
git clone https://@bitbucket.org/hbpneurorobotics/gzweb.git

#Export your NRP-core installation directory as HBP. This variable will be needed to create symlinks to gazebo models
export HBP=/home/${USER}/.local/nrp

# Create necessary directories for gazebo models and gzweb assets:
mkdir -p ${HBP}/gzweb/http/client/assets
mkdir ${HOME}/.gazebo/models

# Run the create-symlinks.sh script from the models repository. This will create necessary symlinks 
# to the models in .gazebo/models, and to the assets in ${HBP}/gzweb/http/client/assets

cd models
./create-symlinks.sh
\endcode

Now it should be possible to run the Husky experiments!

\section time_profile_tools Time Profiling NRPCore Experiments

Some basic tools are included for time profiling the execution of NRPCore experiments.
They can be used to debug bottlenecks in the execution.

In order to enable time profiling, nrp-core must be configured with `-DENABLE_TIME_PROFILE=ON`:

\code
cmake -DENABLE_TIME_PROFILE=ON <other configuration parameters> ..
\endcode

see this \ref tutorial_developer_guide_time_profiler "page" for more details.

After this is done, running an NRPCore experiment will generate a set of log files containing profiling information.
The files are stored in a directory: `<experiment_folder>/time_logs<time_stamp>`.
Each of these files contain a list of time points (one for each simulation loop step) corresponding to each of the sub-steps in a loop step. More information about the simulation loop step structure can be found in this \ref step_structure page.
All the time data is express in microseconds wrt a fixed time point with no relevance.
Thus, data is meant to analyzed by comparing time differences between the same rows of different files.

The files containing simulation loop sub-step temporal information are:

- step_start.log: marks the start of the simulation loop step
- after_wait_for_engines.log: time after engines which are being synced in this step has finished their simulations
- after_get_datapacks.log: time after required datapacks have been received from the corresponding Engines
- after_run_tfs.log: time after PFs and TFs have been executed
- after_send_datapacks.log: time after datapacks returned by TFs have been sent to the corresponding Engines
- after_restart_engines.log: time after synced Engines have been re-started

Additionally, two files containing processed data are stored:

- step_duration.log: contains the list of simulation loop step durations in microseconds. Corresponds to `after_restart_engines - step_start` in the aforementioned files
- experiment_stats.log: contains the full run time of the NRPCoreSim process plus the duration of each of the calls to the \ref experiment_lifecycle "SimulationManager lifecycle transitions"

A python script is provided to plot logged profiling data.
It can be found at `tools/python plot_sim_loop.py`.
It takes as argument a list of directories separated by spaces containing profiling data generated by NRPCore.
It plots a graph with the duration of each simulation loop sub-steps in milliseconds and prints some stats from this data.
The maximum number of log directories that can be plotted together is four.

As an example, below is shown a plot from a run of the `examples/husky_braitenberg` experiment:

And the accompanying printout stats from the script:

\image html experiment_time_profile.png "Plotted simulation loop profile data"

\code
NRPCoreSim execution time: 11183.743 (ms)
Initializing Simulation: 3092.096 (ms)
Running Simulation: 7681.026 (ms)
Shutting down Simulation: 62.319 (ms)
Shutting down Simulation: 0.069 (ms)

loop step duration (mean): 15.342966 (ms)
wait for engines step completion (mean): 9.843093999999999 (ms)
get datapacks (mean): 1.885496 (ms)
run tfs (mean): 1.004954 (ms)
send datapacks (mean): 2.465828 (ms)
restart engines (mean): 0.120026 (ms)
\endcode

The script has some dependencies which are not installed during the nrp-core installation guide, you might need to install them manually before running the script.
